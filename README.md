## 🎗 Overview
Building upon our [previously published work](https://github.com/kanchanmaurya95/PinkGuardian.git) in IEEE, Pink Guardian 2.0 represents a significant advancement in breast cancer detection technology. This enhanced version introduces a more robust model trained on 400,000 mammogram images, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive breast cancer detection models available.

## 🔬 Key Improvements
- *Expanded Dataset*: Training on 400,000 mammogram images (previous version used significantly smaller dataset)
- *Enhanced Model Architecture*: Improved version of BC-Inception V3
- *End-User Focus*: Completely redesigned application interface for better accessibility
- *Healthcare Integration*: Partnership with Sync Healthcare for improved clinical validation

## 👥 Research Team
- *Kanchan Maurya* - Lead Researcher (Continuing from previous work)
- *Sayed Raheel Hussain* - Research Contributor
- *Tushar Sinha* - Research Contributor
- *Deepa Paikar* - Research App Contributor
- *Saddam Hussain* - Research App Contributor
